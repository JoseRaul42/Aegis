To fulfill the user's request, I will create a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of the task. Here is the graph:

1. **Task**: Compare the market cap of Google and Apple
2. **Subtask 1**: Retrieve current market capitalization data for Google
	* **Sub-subtask 1.1**: Fetch Google's stock price from a reliable source (e.g., Yahoo Finance)
	* **Sub-subtask 1.2**: Calculate Google's market capitalization using the fetched stock price and outstanding shares
3. **Subtask 2**: Retrieve current market capitalization data for Apple
	* **Sub-subtask 2.1**: Fetch Apple's stock price from a reliable source (e.g., Yahoo Finance)
	* **Sub-subtask 2.2**: Calculate Apple's market capitalization using the fetched stock price and outstanding shares
4. **Comparison**: Compare the calculated market capitalizations of Google and Apple

To divide and complete this work, I recommend the following AI agents:

1. **Agent A (Data Retrieval)**: Responsible for fetching the current market capitalization data for both Google and Apple.
2. **Agent B (Calculation)**: Responsible for calculating the market capitalizations using the fetched data from Agent A.
3. **Agent C (Comparison)**: Responsible for comparing the calculated market capitalizations of Google and Apple.

These three agents can work together to complete the task efficiently, with Agent A handling data retrieval, Agent B performing calculations, and Agent C making the comparison. This division of labor ensures that each agent focuses on its specific task, reducing the overall workload and increasing productivity. |
