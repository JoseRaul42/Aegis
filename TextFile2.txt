Here is the DAG of the task:

1. **User Input**: The user provides input to me, which is a statement expressing gratitude.
2. **Text Analysis**: I analyze the text to understand its meaning and intent.
3. **Task Identification**: Based on the analysis, I identify that the user wants to express appreciation for my assistance.
4. **Response Generation**: I generate a response acknowledging their gratitude and providing any necessary follow-up information.

Here's how an AI agent like me should approach this problem:

1.  **Text Analysis**: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the input text, including sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and intent identification.
2.  **Task Identification**: Based on the analysis, identify the user's intent and determine the task at hand. In this case, it's a simple expression of gratitude.
3.  **Response Generation**: Use a response generation model to create a suitable response that acknowledges their gratitude and provides any necessary follow-up information.

In this specific case, my response would be: "You're welcome! I'm glad I could help." This response acknowledges the user's gratitude and provides a friendly closing message.
